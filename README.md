ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Krzysztof. 

I write code at work and for fun. 

Professionally I do a lot of database stuff (Oracle, Postgresql/Greenplum), I use Scala (+Spark), Java and Python as my primary languages.

I love retro computing so you may find some Z80 assembler programs, FPGAs and Arduino. I'm recreating retro computers all by myself including schematics, PCB layout, board etching and soldering. I also write simulators of old CPUs and machines (e.g. Z80 and ZX Spectrum) and play with ancient language of Basic.

Cheers 

Krzys
